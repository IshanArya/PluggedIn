# Cursor Rule Header: Description and Globs

## Rule
- Always add the `description` and `globs` fields in the YAML header (metadata block) at the top of each `.mdc` rule file.
- Do **not** add `## Description` or `## Globs` as Markdown headings in the rule content.

## Reasoning
- Centralizes rule metadata for easier parsing and automation.
- Follows the [Cursor Rules Instructions](mdc:cursor-rules-creation.mdc) for rule formatting and structure.
- Prevents duplication and confusion between metadata and content.

## Bad Example
```mdc
---
globs: "**/*.ts,**/*.tsx"
---
# My Rule

## Description
This rule does something important.
```

## Good Example
```mdc
---
description: This rule does something important.
globs: "**/*.ts,**/*.tsx"
---
# My Rule
```
