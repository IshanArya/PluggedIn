# Cursor Rule YAML Header Globs Standard

All Cursor rule files must have a YAML header with a `globs` field that aggressively matches the appropriate file types for the rule's domain:

- **TypeScript rules**: `globs: "**/*.ts,**/*.tsx"`
- **React/component rules**: `globs: "**/*.js,**/*.jsx,**/*.ts,**/*.tsx"`
- **Global/project-wide rules (tooling, npm, etc.)**: `globs: "**/*.js,**/*.jsx,**/*.ts,**/*.tsx,**/*.json,**/*.yml,**/*.yaml,**/*.env,**/*.md,**/*.mdc"`
- **Rule creation/management**: `globs: "**/*.mdc"`
- **Other rules**: Use the most aggressive and relevant glob for the rule's domain

## Enforcement
- Always update or add the `globs` field in the YAML header when creating or editing a rule file.
- The `globs` field must not be empty and must match the rule's intended file types.
- This rule always applies to all `.mdc` rule files.
- **Note:** For `.mdc` rule files, you may need to use command-line tools (e.g., `sed`) to modify YAML headers, as some editors may not allow direct editing of these fields.
