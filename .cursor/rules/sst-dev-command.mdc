description: Use `npx sst dev` to start the app in development mode with full SST integration. Always check if a dev server is already running (default port 5173) before starting a new one. Use this rule whenever you want to run the app locally for development, testing, or infrastructure changes.

# Starting the App with SST

## When to Use
- Use the `sst dev` command to start the application in development mode.
- This command should be used whenever you want to run the app locally with hot reloading and full SST integration (including serverless, API, and frontend).
- Do **not** use `npm run dev` or other dev commands unless specifically instructed for a different context.

## Before Starting
- **Always check if a development server is already running** before starting a new one.
- Look for existing terminal sessions/processes that might be running `sst dev`.
- Check if ports are already in use (typically 5173, 5174, etc.).
- If a server is already running, use that instance instead of starting a new one.
- Starting multiple dev servers can cause port conflicts and unexpected behavior.

## How to Start
1. **Check for existing servers first:**
   - Look for running terminal sessions with `sst dev`
   - Check if the expected URLs are already accessible in your browser
   - If unsure, try visiting `http://localhost:5173` or similar ports

2. If no server is running, open your terminal and navigate to the project root directory.

3. Run:
   ```sh
   npx sst dev
   ```

4. The app will start with hot reloading and all SST features enabled.

## Notes
- The app will be available at the local URL printed in the terminal (commonly `http://localhost:5173` or similar).
- This is the recommended way to develop and test the full stack of the application.
- If you make changes to infrastructure or serverless code, `sst dev` will automatically reload as needed.
- **Only run one `sst dev` instance at a time** to avoid conflicts.

## Example
```sh
# First, check if server is already running
# If not, then start:
npx sst dev
```
