# Starting the App with SST

## When to Use
- Use the `sst dev` command to start the application in development mode.
- This command should be used whenever you want to run the app locally with hot reloading and full SST integration (including serverless, API, and frontend).
- Do **not** use `npm run dev` or other dev commands unless specifically instructed for a different context.

## How to Start
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project root directory.
2. Run:
   ```sh
   npx sst dev
   ```
3. The app will start with hot reloading and all SST features enabled.

## Notes
- The app will be available at the local URL printed in the terminal (commonly `http://localhost:3000` or similar).
- This is the recommended way to develop and test the full stack of the application.
- If you make changes to infrastructure or serverless code, `sst dev` will automatically reload as needed.

## Example
```sh
npx sst dev
```
