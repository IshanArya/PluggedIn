# Spec Creation and Linking Rule

Whenever a new specification (spec) is written for this project:

1. The spec **must** be added to the [`specs/`](mdc:specs) folder as a markdown file.
2. The spec **must** be linked in the main table in [`SPECS.md`](mdc:SPECS.md) with an appropriate description and file link.
3. The link should follow the format and conventions already present in the table.

This ensures all specs are discoverable and consistently documented in the project.
