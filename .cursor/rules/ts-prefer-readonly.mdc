# TypeScript: Prefer Readonly and Const

1. Use `const` for variables that are never reassigned.
2. Use `readonly` for properties and array types that should not be mutated.

```typescript
// Good
const API_URL = "https://api.example.com";
interface User {
  readonly id: string;
  name: string;
}

// Bad
let API_URL = "https://api.example.com";
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}
```
