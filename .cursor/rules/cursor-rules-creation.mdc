# Cursor Rules Location & .mdc Format Conventions

How to add new cursor rules to the project and ensure they follow the correct .mdc format:

1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
    ```
    .cursor/rules/
    ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    ├── another-rule.mdc
    └── ...
    ```

2. Follow the naming convention:
    - Use kebab-case for filenames
    - Always use .mdc extension
    - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. Directory structure:
    ```
    PROJECT_ROOT/
    ├── .cursor/
    │   └── rules/
    │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    │       └── ...
    └── ...
    ```

4. Never place rule files:
    - In the project root
    - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
    - In any other location

5. All .mdc rule files must start with a valid YAML frontmatter block:
    ```
    ---
    description: Short description of the rule's purpose
    globs: path/pattern/**/*
    alwaysApply: true|false
    ---
    ```

6. The main content must use markdown formatting, including a clear title (as a heading), step-by-step instructions, code examples, and guidelines.

7. Example:
    ```markdown
