# Modern Tooling and Practices

## Rule
Always use the latest stable, non-deprecated tools, commands, and practices for all development, configuration, and automation tasks in this project.

## Guidelines
1. **Do not use deprecated commands, flags, or APIs.**
   - Always check official documentation or release notes for deprecation warnings.
2. **Prefer officially recommended setup and configuration methods.**
   - For example, use `npx husky init` instead of deprecated `husky install` or `husky add`.
3. **Keep dependencies and tooling up to date.**
   - Regularly check for updates and breaking changes.
4. **Document any workarounds or legacy support clearly in code comments.**
5. **If a tool or method is deprecated, migrate to the recommended alternative as soon as possible.**

## Example
- ❌ **Deprecated:**
  ```sh
  npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run lint"
  ```
- ✅ **Modern:**
  ```sh
  npx husky init
  # Then manually edit the hook script as needed
  ```

## Enforcement
- PRs and code reviews should reject use of deprecated tooling or practices.
- Automated scripts and documentation must reflect current best practices.
