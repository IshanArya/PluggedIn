# Technical Considerations

## Security
- Never expose the Spotify Client Secret in client-side code.
- Store sensitive credentials in environment variables (for local development, use `.env`).
- Use HTTPS for all redirect URIs in production.

## Error Handling
- Handle failed authentication and token expiration gracefully.
- Display user-friendly error messages for API failures.
- Log errors to the console for debugging (in development only).

## Environment Variables
- `VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`: Spotify Client ID
- `VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI`: Redirect URI registered with Spotify
- (Never store the Client Secret in the frontend)

## Token Storage
- Store access tokens in memory or localStorage (for demo only; production apps should use secure storage).
- Clear tokens on logout.
